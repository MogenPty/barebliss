Naturism, also known as nudism, is a cultural and lifestyle movement that advocates for and embraces social nudity. The term "naturism" is often used to emphasize the connection with nature and the idea of living in harmony with the natural environment. Individuals who practice naturism, called naturists or nudists, believe in the positive effects of nudity on physical and mental well-being, body acceptance, and a more open and honest social environment.

Naturism can take various forms, including organized activities such as nude beaches, naturist clubs, resorts, and events where like-minded individuals gather to socialize without clothing. It's important to note that naturism is not inherently sexual; rather, it focuses on the freedom, comfort, and acceptance of the human body in a non-sexualized context.

Naturist principles often include respect for oneself and others, a sense of equality and non-judgment, and an appreciation for the natural world. The degree of social acceptance and legality of naturism varies across cultures and countries, with some places having designated areas for nude recreation and others where it is prohibited.
